# ERV-CORE
A record and repository for ERV CORE data

This repository is meant to house documentation and auxilliary data for the 2022 UoM-ERV CORE study, conducted by Colin Gallagher and Kate Brady. 
This repository DOES NOT share the survey data itself, which is scheduled to be shared visa ADA repository. 
Personally identifying data have been removed from the share dataset.
Those interested in the data should contact the UoM research team or the ERV Reearch and Evaluation team for further up-to-date information.

The project is covered by UoM Ethics approval 23373.

The .sps files pertain to transformations that HAVE ALREADY OCCURRED with the shared datafile. They do not need to be rerun unless bugs are found.

A data dictionary is also included.

A further .sav file contains locational concordances for administrative regions in which the survey was conducted.
